# Weather App
# Overview

This is a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions in their location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data, and displays it in a simple, easy-to-use interface.
Usage

To use the app, simply open it in a web browser and allow it to access your location. The app will use your location data to retrieve the current weather conditions for your area.

Note: In order for the app to function properly, you will need to request temporary access to the CORS proxy located at this link: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/. This is necessary to bypass CORS restrictions and allow the app to make API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. To request access, simply click the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button on the CORS Anywhere homepage and follow the instructions.
